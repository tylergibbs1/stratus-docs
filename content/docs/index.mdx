description: A TypeScript agent SDK for Azure OpenAI
---

Stratus is a TypeScript SDK for building AI agents powered by Azure OpenAI. It provides a clean, composable API for multi-turn conversations, tool use, multi-agent handoffs, streaming, guardrails, and tracing.

## Features

- **Agents** — Define agents with instructions, tools, and model settings
- **Sessions** — Multi-turn conversations with persistent message history, save/resume/fork
- **Tools** — Type-safe tool definitions with Zod schema validation
- **Subagents** — Delegate work to child agents as tool calls
- **Streaming** — Real-time streaming with abort signal cancellation
- **Structured Output** — Parse model output into typed objects via Zod
- **Multimodal** — Send text and images in user messages
- **Handoffs** — Route conversations between specialized agents
- **Guardrails** — Input and output validation with tripwire support
- **Hooks** — Lifecycle callbacks with permission control (allow/deny/modify)
- **Tracing** — Built-in span-based tracing via `AsyncLocalStorage`
- **Azure Native** — First-class Azure OpenAI Chat Completions support

## Quick Example

```ts
import { AzureChatCompletionsModel } from "stratus";
import { createSession, tool } from "stratus/core";
import { z } from "zod";

const model = new AzureChatCompletionsModel({
  endpoint: process.env.AZURE_ENDPOINT!,
  apiKey: process.env.AZURE_API_KEY!,
  deployment: "gpt-4o",
});

const getWeather = tool({
  name: "get_weather",
  description: "Get current weather for a city",
  parameters: z.object({ city: z.string() }),
  execute: async (_ctx, { city }) => `72°F and sunny in ${city}`,
});

await using session = createSession({
  model,
  instructions: "You are a weather assistant.",
  tools: [getWeather],
});

session.send("What's the weather in NYC?");
for await (const event of session.stream()) {
  if (event.type === "content_delta") process.stdout.write(event.content);
}

// Multi-turn: context persists automatically
session.send("What about London?");
for await (const event of session.stream()) {
  if (event.type === "content_delta") process.stdout.write(event.content);
}
```

## Architecture

Stratus is organized into two layers:

| Package | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `stratus/core` | Provider-agnostic: Agent, Session, run loop, tools, handoffs, guardrails, hooks, tracing |
| `stratus` | Re-exports core + Azure OpenAI implementation |

The core layer defines the `Model` interface. Azure is the built-in implementation, but you can plug in any provider by implementing `Model`.
