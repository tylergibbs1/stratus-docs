Model settings control how the model generates responses. You set them on the agent at construction time.

## Setting on an agent

Pass a `modelSettings` object when creating an agent:

```ts title="agent-settings.ts"
import { Agent } from "stratus/core";

const agent = new Agent({
  name: "assistant",
  model,
  modelSettings: {
    temperature: 0.7,
    maxTokens: 1000,
  },
});
```

Settings are sent to the model on every call the agent makes. To change settings between runs, clone the agent with new values:

```ts title="clone-settings.ts"
const creativeAgent = agent.clone({
  modelSettings: { temperature: 1.2, topP: 0.95 },
});
```

## ModelSettings reference

| Setting | Type | Default | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `temperature` | `number` | Model default | Sampling temperature. Higher values (closer to 2) produce more random output. Lower values (closer to 0) produce more deterministic output. Range: 0--2. |
| `topP` | `number` | Model default | Nucleus sampling. The model considers tokens whose cumulative probability exceeds this threshold. Range: 0--1. |
| `maxTokens` | `number` | Model default | Maximum number of tokens to generate in the response. |
| `stop` | `string[]` | `undefined` | Stop sequences. The model stops generating when it produces any of these strings. |
| `presencePenalty` | `number` | `0` | Penalizes tokens that have already appeared, encouraging the model to talk about new topics. Range: -2 to 2. |
| `frequencyPenalty` | `number` | `0` | Penalizes tokens proportional to how often they've appeared, reducing repetition. Range: -2 to 2. |
| `toolChoice` | `ToolChoice` | `"auto"` | Controls which tools the model can call. See [Tool choice](#tool-choice). |
| `parallelToolCalls` | `boolean` | `true` | Whether the model can call multiple tools in a single turn. |
| `seed` | `number` | `undefined` | Seed for deterministic sampling. Repeated requests with the same seed and parameters should return the same result. |

## Tool choice

The `toolChoice` setting controls whether and how the model calls tools. Set it inside `modelSettings`.

<Tabs items={["auto", "required", "none", "Specific function"]}>
<Tab value="auto">

The default. The model decides whether to call a tool or respond with text.

```ts title="tool-choice-auto.ts"
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "assistant",
  model,
  tools: [getWeather],
  modelSettings: {
    toolChoice: "auto", // [!code highlight]
  },
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="required">

Forces the model to call at least one tool. It will not respond with text alone.

```ts title="tool-choice-required.ts"
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "assistant",
  model,
  tools: [getWeather, searchDocs],
  modelSettings: {
    toolChoice: "required", // [!code highlight]
  },
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="none">

Prevents the model from calling any tools, even if tools are defined on the agent. The model responds with text only.

```ts title="tool-choice-none.ts"
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "assistant",
  model,
  tools: [getWeather],
  modelSettings: {
    toolChoice: "none", // [!code highlight]
  },
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="Specific function">

Forces the model to call one specific tool by name. Useful when you know exactly which tool should run.

```ts title="tool-choice-function.ts"
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "assistant",
  model,
  tools: [getWeather, searchDocs],
  modelSettings: {
    toolChoice: { // [!code highlight]
      type: "function", // [!code highlight]
      function: { name: "get_weather" }, // [!code highlight]
    }, // [!code highlight]
  },
});
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

## Tool use behavior

`toolUseBehavior` is separate from `modelSettings`. It is set directly on the agent and controls what happens _after_ a tool executes -- not what the model generates.

<Tabs items={["run_llm_again", "stop_on_first_tool", "stopAtToolNames"]}>
<Tab value="run_llm_again">

The default. After a tool executes, the result is sent back to the model so it can generate a follow-up response or call more tools.

```ts title="behavior-run-again.ts"
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "assistant",
  model,
  tools: [getWeather],
  toolUseBehavior: "run_llm_again", // [!code highlight]
});
```

</Tab>
<Tab value="stop_on_first_tool">

Stops the run immediately after the first tool call completes. The tool's return value becomes the run output. The model is not called again.

```ts title="behavior-stop-first.ts"
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "data-fetcher",
  model,
  tools: [fetchData],
  toolUseBehavior: "stop_on_first_tool", // [!code highlight]
});

const result = await run(agent, "Get the latest sales data");
// result.output is the return value of fetchData
```

This is useful when the agent's only job is to pick and invoke the right tool.

</Tab>
<Tab value="stopAtToolNames">

Stops only when a specific tool is called. Other tools feed their results back to the model as usual.

```ts title="behavior-stop-at.ts"
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "researcher",
  model,
  tools: [searchDocs, summarize, finalAnswer],
  toolUseBehavior: { // [!code highlight]
    stopAtToolNames: ["final_answer"], // [!code highlight]
  }, // [!code highlight]
});
```

The agent can call `searchDocs` and `summarize` as many times as it needs. The run stops only when it calls `final_answer`.

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Callout type="info">
`toolUseBehavior` is set on the Agent, not in `modelSettings`. It controls what happens after a tool executes, not what the model generates.
</Callout>

## Response format

Structured output is configured via `outputType` on the agent, not through `modelSettings` directly. When you set `outputType` to a Zod schema, Stratus sends the appropriate `response_format` to Azure automatically.

```ts
const agent = new Agent({
  name: "extractor",
  model,
  outputType: z.object({
    name: z.string(),
    age: z.number(),
  }),
});
```

See [Structured Output](/docs/structured-output) for details.
